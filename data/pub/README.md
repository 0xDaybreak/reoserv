# Pub files

Put your pub files in this directory (Items, NPCs, Spells, Classes)

## Server pubs

Reoserv will also load and use the server side pub files as described [here](https://tehsausage.com/temporary/neweopub.txt).

## JSON pubs

You can also put JSON files in the sub-directories here and enable the `generate_pub` configuration option.

JSON files can be generated from [pub2json](https://github.com/sorokya/pub2json).
